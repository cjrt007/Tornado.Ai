# Tornado.ai UI

This directory will host the React + TypeScript frontend powered by Tailwind CSS and Zustand.
The initial scaffold is pending implementation. Planned features include:

- Real-time dashboards powered by the SRTD component family.
- Tool execution interface with progress visualization (PVT) and vulnerability cards (IVC).
- Report generation workflows, MFA setup, and checklist management screens.

## Getting Started

A Vite + React + TypeScript bootstrap will be added in subsequent iterations. Once ready, run:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The UI development server will run on `http://localhost:3000`.
